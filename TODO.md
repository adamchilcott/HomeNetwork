# Feature Requests

Nice things that would be a great addition to this repository. 

### Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6

My ISP only supports IPv4 and more than likely using Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT). I would love to learn more about IPv6 Address Spacing and get my head around that and apply to the config.

### Split-Tunnel 3rd-Party VPN

I've seen plenty of tutorials implementing OpenVPN for the EdgeRouter X but none leveraging IKEv2 which is Hardware Accelerated on the ERX. Plenty of 3rd-Party VPN Services now offer IKEv2 from the get-go.

### Quality of Service/Traffic Control

I have some basic traffic control features turned-on, but it would be nice to get my head around DSCP/802.1P, which the TL-SG105PE and ERX support according to the product documentation and apply accordingly.
